# BadassBash

This is my own personal `bash` template that I like to use to make unecessarily flashy `bash` scripts.

Over time, I'll continue to add useful functions, output, parsing tools and so on to create a repository of
beautiful `bash` knowledge.

The scripts will be intended to take full advantage of `bash` functionality, which might require the latest
versions of the shell, and as such, may not be particularly portable. Where possible, portable syntax will be
used, and the `/portability` folder will contain portable snippets to emulate functions which may otherwise
not be which could be subbed in.

`/functions` will contain generally useful functions which can be incorporated in to other scripts. Where
possible I like to keep everything to pure `bash`, and at a push, `coreutils`. This means the code might not
be especially efficient, but should be easy to use and glue together.


# Disclaimer

Some of this code will be taken from around the web, and I'll endeavour to link/cite where possible, but I
frequently forget where I find it so if you see something of yours and you'd like credit where it's due, feel
free to contact me or open and Issue/PR.
